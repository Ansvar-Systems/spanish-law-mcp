# Legal Disclaimer

**READ THIS CAREFULLY BEFORE USING THIS SOFTWARE**

## Not Legal Advice

This software (the "Tool") is provided for **informational and research purposes only**. It does **NOT** constitute professional legal advice, and must not be relied upon as a substitute for professional legal counsel.

### What This Means

- **No Attorney-Client Relationship**: Use of this Tool does not create an attorney-client relationship (relación abogado-cliente)
- **No Professional Responsibility**: The authors and contributors assume no professional responsibility for decisions made based on information from this Tool
- **Verification Required**: ALL legal information, citations, and conclusions must be independently verified with official sources and qualified legal professionals before being relied upon

## Professional Use Warnings

### For Legal Professionals

If you are a lawyer (abogado/a), legal researcher, or other legal professional:

- **Malpractice Risk**: Relying on unverified information from this Tool in professional legal work may constitute professional malpractice (mala praxis profesional)
- **Professional Obligations**: You remain solely responsible for verifying all citations, statutes, and legal positions before advising clients or filing documents
- **Professional Rules**: Members of the Consejo General de la Abogacía Española (CGAE) and regional bar associations (Colegios de Abogados) must comply with the Código Deontológico de la Abogacía Española and applicable professional conduct rules when using AI tools
- **Client Disclosure**: Consider whether professional ethics rules require disclosing AI tool use to clients

### Duty of Independent Verification

**YOU MUST VERIFY EVERYTHING.** Do not cite, quote, or rely on any provision, case law, or legal interpretation from this Tool without:

1. Checking the official source (Boletín Oficial del Estado (boe.es))
2. Verifying the provision is currently in force (vigente) and has not been amended (modificada) or repealed (derogada)
3. Reading the full context of cited provisions
4. Consulting case law (jurisprudencia) from the Tribunal Supremo and relevant courts, as well as legislative history (exposición de motivos)
5. Considering how recent legal developments may affect the matter

## Data Authority and Limitations

### Source Authority

This Tool aggregates data from official Spanish legal databases. However:

| Source Type | Authority Level | Use Case |
|------------|----------------|----------|
| **Official government databases (BOE)** | Authoritative | Statute text (primary reference) |
| **Community/open-data sources (Noticias Jurídicas)** | Supplementary | Legal summaries, cross-references (verify independently) |
| **EUR-Lex / treaty databases** | Authoritative for EU/international law | EU regulations, directives, international obligations |

**CRITICAL**: Community-maintained resources are **NOT** official government publications. While generally reliable, they may contain transcription errors, outdated information, or incomplete coverage.

### Commercial Legal Databases

For professional legal work, **always cross-check with commercial legal databases** such as:

- Aranzadi (Thomson Reuters), Tirant lo Blanch, La Ley Digital (Wolters Kluwer)

These services provide editorial oversight, comprehensive annotations (doctrina y jurisprudencia), and professional-grade currency guarantees that this Tool **cannot** provide.

## Currency and Staleness

### No Real-Time Updates

- Database updates are **manual** and may lag official publications by **weeks or months**
- Spanish law changes continuously through new legislation (leyes, reales decretos, órdenes ministeriales), amendments, and court decisions
- **Last-updated timestamps** in tool responses indicate data age, but should be treated as unreliable

### Staleness Warnings

The Tool includes staleness warnings when data is >30 days old. **These warnings are not exhaustive**:

- Even "fresh" data may be outdated if recent amendments were published in the BOE
- Staleness warnings do not guarantee completeness or accuracy
- Always check official sources for the current legal position (estado de vigencia)

### Amendments and Repeals

- A provision marked "in force" (vigente) may have been:
  - Amended (modificada) after the last database update
  - Repealed (derogada) but not yet removed from the database
  - Subject to transitional rules (disposiciones transitorias) affecting its applicability
- The Tool does **NOT** automatically track amendments in real-time

## Coverage Gaps

### What's Missing

This Tool does **NOT** include:

1. **Complete case law (jurisprudencia)** -- Coverage is limited; do not rely solely on this for case law research from the Tribunal Supremo, Tribunal Constitucional, or Audiencias Provinciales
2. **Historical statute versions** -- Limited availability of historical provision wording (versiones anteriores)
3. **Legal commentary (doctrina)** -- No editorial annotations, academic commentary, or practice guides
4. **Unpublished decisions** -- Lower court decisions and administrative rulings largely absent
5. **Full legislative history** -- Limited coverage of parliamentary debates (Diario de Sesiones) and explanatory memoranda (exposiciones de motivos)
6. **Autonomous Community legislation** -- Coverage of regional laws (Comunidades Autónomas) may be incomplete

### Impact on Professional Use

These gaps mean:

- **Incomplete Legal Research**: Tool results are inherently incomplete and may miss critical authorities
- **Context Missing**: Without commentary and legislative history, interpretation may be incorrect
- **Regional Law Blind Spots**: Spain's decentralized structure means autonomous community law may be missed
- **EU Law Blind Spots**: Cannot fully assess EU directive transposition or compliance

## No Warranties

### "AS IS" -- No Guarantees

Per the Apache 2.0 license (see [LICENSE](LICENSE)):

- **NO WARRANTY OF ACCURACY**: Data may contain errors, omissions, or outdated information

## AI-Generated Content

This Tool uses **algorithmic search and ranking** that may:

**Human review is MANDATORY** before relying on any AI-generated search results or analysis.

## EU AI Act Compliance

## Recommended Workflow for Professional Use

1. **Initial Research**: Use Tool for preliminary research and hypothesis generation

4. **Professional Judgment**: Apply independent legal analysis and professional judgment
5. **Document Sources**: Cite official sources in legal work, not this Tool
6. **Update Check**: Before finalizing legal work, check for recent amendments and decisions
